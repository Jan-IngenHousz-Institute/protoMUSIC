 * Design: the esp_log vprintf hook formats each line (RTC wall-clock prefix,
 * ANSI colour stripped) into an in-RAM ring buffer — it never touches the SD
 * card, so logging never blocks. A low-priority writer task drains the ring to
 * /sdcard/logs/ambyte.log, rotating at SD_LOGGER_FILE_BYTES across
 * SD_LOGGER_MAX_FILES files (current + rotated). While the card is absent the
 * ring holds lines (dropping the newest on overflow) and flushes once it
 * mounts; on a mid-run pull the file is closed and reopened on reinsertion. */
